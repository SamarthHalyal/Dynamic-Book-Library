# Dynamic-Book-Library

This servers best for needs of a small dynamic library where book are stored in database (in this project not real database but
a file)...import the code in Xcode or eclipse (c++) and run to see the magic....simple but elegant code design
IT KEEPS THE TRACK OF BOOKS PRESENT AND SENT OUT
